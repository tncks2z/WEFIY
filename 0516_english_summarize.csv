0,악의마음을읽는자들,"The drama is based on a non-fiction book written as Korea's first crime profiler, mostly made up of real-life events in Korea. The plot is simple, chronological like a documentary, and runs across the ages several times to show the past."
1,라이프온마스,"it's a really good drama to watch the lives of the two versions in this review, but I want to see the next episode based on my view that I have a completely different storyline from British City."
2,옷소매붉은끝동,The drama is also based on the story of a woman who did her best not to fall into the biggest system in the Joseon Dynasty until the end.

4,어느날우리집현관으로멸망이들어왔다,"A fantasy romance for dramatic slow-burning enemies worth showing to lovers, leading wonderful acting dizzy chemistry, beautiful humor, innovative soundtracks, and more. It is a unique slow video drama and a gift that continues to be given"
5,스물다섯스물하나,"But as some people say, the ending didn't open, and I honestly don't think we need to answer all our questions. The story was not about finding Kim Min-chae's father."
6,무브투헤븐:나는유품정리사입니다,"Literally, it is one of the best kdrama of all time with its beautiful movie design and perfect social commentary. The story was so touching and healing, and the acting was so good that it was good enough to win a minimal nomination for one of the categories."

15,술꾼도시여자들,"Hehe Thaaanks a lotThe language tone and the way they speak is everyday language, not drama tone language and that's partly why it also appeals to koreans about what I'm told that it's not just about the swearing but the daily life."
