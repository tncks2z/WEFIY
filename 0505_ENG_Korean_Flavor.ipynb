title written by kwon il yong republic of korea's first profiler and co authored by writer go na moo published in the year created by studio s and wavve through the darkness is directed by park bo ram while seol yi na took the charge of screenwriting which is a debut for both of them master composer gaemi leads the music production while the show was broadcasted on sbs it had a mid season break of weeks due to winter olympics but i guess it proved rewarding to be clear this is not the depiction of the real life events of the profiler but the sequence of events are reflected from reality to a certain extent that's why the novel is nonfiction the drama is setup in late s and shows the process and struggles of establishing the behavioural analysis unit in south korean police force as well as making criminal profiling an important factor of investigation through succeeding years i think this is enough for a gist given the theme and premise of the show inspector song ha young kim na gil is reserved and somewhat introverted with abilities of reading through emotions and is highly piercing having a traumatic experience in early childhood he has grown up into a person who seeks a simple life and want to persue his job with honesty and discipline detective kook young soo jin seon kyu is the chief of forensic analysis unit yet has aspirations to create a behavioural analysis team after being inspired from criminal profiling done by american fbi detective yoon tae goo kim so jin is the leader of special crime squad at seoul riu who always strives to bring justice jung woo ju ryeoun is a statistical analyst in the behavioural analysis team who is young yet determined and hardworking other actors in major roles are baek joon sik lee dae yeon as riu superintendent heo gil pyo kim won hae as special crime squad chief detective nam il young jung soon won as yoo tae goo's partner and oh in tak hong woo jin as the current chief of forensics the performance by each and every major characters as well as supporting plus temporary roles was simple amazing i must mention special credits to kim nam gil and jin seon kyu who obviously were expected to carry the show on their back also the performance from the actors playing serial killers is hugely commendable plot development was stupendous let me inform you that it's neither a steady nor a plot neither a staircase development and doesn't have any connecting plot elements either rather it's more of a biographical documentary of a profiler and him solving cases one after another obviously along with people around him through a passage of time of about half a decade the pilot episodes were impressive and able to make the audience look forward to further might feel a little slow but it's a matter of time you realize that the entire show was intended to be like that the show greatly emphasizes on the methods of intensive profiling through which the male leads not only try to spread out the importance of criminal behavioral analysis but also put efforts into learning themselves there is the least amount of suspense i must mention it's bcs the writer has opted to reveal the culprits at the beginning of the cases itself on that note it's not a psychopath crime thriller or any sort lf murder mystery rather the weightage is on profiling i e how the cops exercise their brains to get to the criminal there are about major culprits throughout and each case starts while the previous is about to end song ha young's growth as a rookie profiler to an expert is worth investing your time into i feel the most amount of credit should go to the screenwriter although the drama is a novel adaptation but turning books into live action isn't as easy since the latter is more of a play script haven't read the original work but from what i saw on sns they have retained originality for most of the parts which should be commended the premises wete aptly setup and the sequence of events were perfectly arranged plus organized the momentary monologues and self notes picked my attention as well even though the focus is hugely concentrated on the mls others received a good amount of exposure as well and on that note the character arcs were drawn with great efforts and the growth in them was clearly conspicuous again especially for the mls i'm sure the directorial debut for park bo ram pdnim has been a fruitful experience directing the screenplay for such a fantastic script indeed would have brought joy to me the show didn't feel like being directed by a rookie at all in fact after watching episodes when i rushed to check out which amazing person has taken the charge it turned out to be someone i never knew of the pacing was perfect the seeming slow paced development made the entire thing more meaningful i felt the cinematography with unlit dim pallettes and dark hue was able to provide pertinent moods and gives given the catastrophic theme of the story the screen editing was good for me with less sound effects and being greatly focused on intense scenarios the criminal chasing and fighting scenes were in fact enjoyable there are soundtracks in total composed by gaemi nim and to the best of the show's vibes i think it would have been still okay with no osts and this number was okay given the least utilization lullaby by nerd connection is a harmonious depiction of dark conflicts between emotions within your heart can't run away by isaac hong is a caliginous urge to give up on everything leopard of mt kilimanjaro by men was the last track what i liked ml doesn't shadows others seemingly nonexistent bromance i couldn't concluded whether it was bromance bcs there was no eye catching portrayal but the things between ha young young soo was full of care affection and mutual respect is all i can say i loved their chemistry as partners who gave their best with the preeminent determination to get to the roots of all the cases as well as to save and develope their team bloom and fall alone is a gloomy call from heart's core about the hostilities one goes through with intriguing vocals of kim so yeon extensive emphasis on profiling oh i guess i'd have mentioned this point first this is the thing that makes the drama one of the best for years i have been waiting for something to come and level up itself with signal and may be it wasn't able to reach that but well it is the one that went the closest which makes me happy no dramatic peak elevation it's expected of a story of any form to have peaks it's one of the essential factors that we all love about but the storytelling method for this drama didn't intend to have clear cut elements of such i've explained the reason above and in fact this fact makes the show more of a realistic piece simple yet powerful and impressive again it isn't a brainy drama with intriguing plot or astonishing revelations everything has been made crystal clear for you from the beginning so what's left for you to see it's the way the detectives analyse and profile an event and personalities of criminals to get through the cause and the culprit indeed the way everything has been executed makes it highly impressive entertaining and worthy of investing your time into apt exposure to side characters i loved how the side characters and their parts were not exaggerated as fillers and were properly used especially for kim so jin ryeoun jung soon won and gong sung ha what i didn't like there's only one thing i didn't like about this drama i e in the screenplay things that could have been explained by the speaker by simply telling the scenarios was shown via quick flashbacks of the event i guess it was a screenplay strategy by the writer and director but it could have been excluded in my opinion nevertheless it didn't ruin the quality of the overall content for me final remarks i didn't have much expectations before starting this ngl and all i relied on was the cast which i admire and also the fact that the drama was on profiling but to my surprise the drama left with no option but to applaud and eulogize everywhere the overall execution of this drama including direction writing performance is definitely to the level of excellency and i would obviously recommend y'all to watch this must watch read more</td>\n",

fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster if you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you this drama is based on a nonfiction book written by south korea's first criminal profiler given this most of the cases all except one in which i am unsure of are based on true cases in s korea the storyline is straightforward and goes in chronological order like a documentary and has several time jumps to show the years passed there were a handful of slow moments but with only episodes they weren't too bad i overlooked them for the tight story development superb acting and perfect ost and bgm some people complain that it's too slow but this is based on true events the writer of this drama can only dramaticize it so far i'm glad they stick to the facts to stay true to the true cases while adding some thrill suspense in catching the killer while the characters don't go deep into psychological analysis of the criminals we can still tell they are paying attention the personality characteristics of the killers and using them to study and prevent others the production paid close attention to detail in recreating the horrid things that occurred in the crimes especially the raincoat killer and southwestern serial killer it was quite informative to learn how criminal profiling came to be accepted in criminal investigations in korea who would have expected them to start in early s i cannot leave without commending kim nam gil who is amazing as song ha young i have no words for how he portrayed the disgust and anger from having to interview serial killers in jail his breakdown later in the drama was heartbreaking and i shed a few tears for him in empathy the rest of the cast were all great too the bromance between ha young and chief kook plus woo joo was cute and lightened up the otherwise super dark heavy drama based on true crimes i really ate up all the rare interactions between ha young and chief kook do give this a

p p i n g all the cases are based on true events and criminals such as yoo young chul therefore the show has a more realistic storyline that doesn't waste time on useless sub plots cough romance or politics cough and really makes you sympathize for the victims from the media press all the way down to the clothes they were wearing when they were arrested is accurate although i would say the red hat killer's case is more fictionalized from lee chun jae please be reminded this is based off profiler kwon il yong's novel from his real accounts of being south korea's first profiler but just a bit more dramatised the drama has a serious cinematic tone but is enjoyable as it shifts between slow burn to some episodes that are very fast paced and intense especially starting from episode that had my jaw unhinged and heart racing the narrative of the criminals are shown in between investigations so you can see them commit crimes which adds to the suspense although keep in mind these criminals are not geniuses and they are humans who can be caught by studying their psychology and behaviour therefore the drama thickens even if they get caught this was also quite a while ago and the police were different back then so you have to be open minded on how they operate with their limited resources but even then they are the least annoying police force i have seen in a crime drama who have logical thinking and encourages their officers everything feels like it's meticulously set in the right time period and small references to notable past events such as and the world cup are made similarly to reply ha young is a quiet but straight forward man and even though he expresses very little kim nam gil is amazing at portraying nuanced emotions his fellow friend and profiler young soo is such a lovable and optimistic character who supports ha young along with their young intern woo joo who is a bit clueless and cute both bring such a lightheartedness to this dark show and also display their cleverness tae goo the one female detective also feels like an actual individual with her own real struggles and goals compared to many other females like her in crime dramas comedic relief is given from most of the main cast like kim won hae and lee dae yeon who are great fun supporting actors in crime dramas the acting is superb from every single character including the criminals everyone has great chemistry together and you can really tell how much the crimes affect the profilers and detectives who express human emotions all the while maintaining detached and objective as they solve crimes like the professionals they are the soundtrack is moody haunting and soft that reflects the drama beautifully and captures the essence of it isaac hong well loved and known the nerd connection a hidden k indie gem kim so yeon an ethereal angel and men triple threat with sweet contrasting voices are the ost singers it's similar to the likes of mind hunter though much more prevalent to korean history and culture it displays how even though america was developing and using profiling methods at that time the rest of the world was just grasping the idea of it it's a brilliant production that's worth watching as you will be completely immersed if you're having deja vu with these cases from seeing it in other dramas it's because these cases literally

       "2       darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that through the darkness literally those who read hearts of evil is a live action adaptation of the nonfiction novel of the same title written by kwon il yong republic of korea's first profiler and co authored by writer go na moo published in the year created by studio s and wavve through the darkness is directed by park bo ram while seol yi na took the charge of screenwriting which is a debut for both of them master composer gaemi leads the music production while the show was broadcasted on sbs it had a mid season break of weeks due to winter olympics but i guess it proved rewarding to be clear this is not the depiction of the real life events of the profiler but the sequence of events are reflected from reality to a certain extent that's why the novel is nonfiction the drama is setup in late s and shows the process and struggles of establishing the behavioural analysis unit in south korean police force as well as making criminal profiling an important factor of investigation through succeeding years i think this is enough for a gist given the theme and premise of the show inspector song ha young kim na gil is reserved and somewhat introverted with abilities of reading through emotions and is highly piercing having a traumatic experience in early childhood he has grown up into a person who seeks a simple life and want to persue his job with honesty and discipline detective kook young soo jin seon kyu is the chief of forensic analysis unit yet has aspirations to create a behavioural analysis team after being inspired from criminal profiling done by american fbi detective yoon tae goo kim so jin is the leader of special crime squad at seoul riu who always strives to bring justice jung woo ju ryeoun

characters as well as supporting plus temporary roles was simple amazing i must mention special credits to kim nam gil and jin seon kyu who obviously were expected to carry the show on their back also the performance from the actors playing serial killers is hugely commendable plot development was stupendous let me inform you that it's neither a steady nor a plot neither a staircase development and doesn't have any connecting plot elements either rather it's more of a biographical documentary of a profiler and him solving cases one after another obviously along with people around him through a passage of time of about half a decade the pilot episodes were impressive and able to make the audience look forward to further might feel a little slow but it's a matter of time you realize that the entire show was intended to be like that the show greatly emphasizes on the methods of intensive profiling through which the male leads not only try to spread out the importance of criminal behavioral analysis but also put efforts into learning themselves there is the least amount of suspense i must mention it's bcs the writer has opted to reveal the culprits at the beginning of the cases itself on that note it's not a psychopath crime thriller or any sort lf murder mystery rather the weightage is on profiling i e how the cops exercise their brains to get to the criminal there are about major culprits throughout and each case starts while the previous is about to end song ha young's growth as a rookie profiler to an expert is worth investing your time into i feel the most amount of credit should go to the screenwriter although the drama is a novel adaptation but turning books into live action isn't as easy since the latter is more of a play script haven't read the original work but from what i saw on sns they have retained originality for most of the parts which should be commended the premises wete aptly setup and the sequence of events were perfectly arranged plus organized the momentary monologues and self notes picked my attention as well even though the focus is hugely concentrated on the mls others received a good amount of exposure as well and on that note the character arcs were drawn with great efforts and the growth in them was clearly conspicuous again especially for the mls i'm sure the directorial debut for park bo ram pdnim has been a fruitful experience directing the screenplay for such a fantastic script indeed would have brought joy to me the show didn't feel like being directed by a rookie at all in fact after watching episodes when i rushed to check out which amazing person has taken the charge it turned out to be someone i never knew of the pacing was perfect the seeming slow paced development made the entire thing more meaningful i felt the cinematography with unlit dim pallettes and dark hue was able to provide pertinent moods and gives given the catastrophic theme of the story the screen editing was good for me with less sound effects and being greatly focused on intense scenarios the criminal chasing and fighting scenes were in fact enjoyable there are soundtracks in total composed by gaemi nim and to the best of the show's vibes i think it would have been still okay with no osts and this number was okay given the least utilization lullaby by nerd connection is a harmonious depiction of dark conflicts between emotions within your heart can't run away by isaac hong is a caliginous urge to give up on everything leopard of mt kilimanjaro by men was the last track what i liked ml doesn't shadows others seemingly nonexistent bromance i couldn't concluded whether it was bromance bcs there was no eye catching portrayal but the things between ha young young soo was full of care affection and mutual respect is all i can say i loved their chemistry as partners who gave their best with the preeminent determination to get to the roots of all the cases as well as to save and develope their team bloom and fall alone is a gloomy call from heart's core about the hostilities one goes through with intriguing vocals of kim so yeon extensive emphasis on profiling oh i guess i'd have mentioned this point first this is the thing that makes the drama one of the best for years i have been waiting for something to come and level up itself with signal and may be it wasn't able to reach that but well it is the one that went the closest which makes me happy no dramatic peak elevation it's expected of a story of any form to have peaks it's one of the essential factors that we all love about but the storytelling method for this drama didn't intend to have clear cut elements of such i've explained the reason above and in fact this fact makes the show more of a realistic piece simple yet powerful and impressive again it isn't a brainy drama with intriguing plot or astonishing revelations everything has been made crystal clear for you from the beginning so what's left for you to see it's the way the detectives analyse and profile an event and personalities of criminals to get through the cause and the culprit indeed the way everything has been executed makes it highly impressive entertaining and worthy of investing your time into apt exposure to side characters i loved how the side characters and their parts were not exaggerated as fillers and were properly used especially for kim so jin ryeoun jung soon won and gong sung ha what i didn't like there's only one thing i didn't like about this drama i e in the screenplay things that could have been explained by the speaker by simply telling the scenarios was shown via quick flashbacks of the event i guess it was a screenplay strategy by the writer and director but it could have been excluded in my opinion nevertheless it didn't ruin the quality of the overall content for me final remarks i didn't have much expectations before starting this ngl and all i relied on was the cast which i admire and also the fact that the drama was on profiling but to my surprise the drama left with no option but to applaud and eulogize everywhere the overall execution of this drama including direction writing performance is definitely to the level of excellency and i would obviously recommend y'all to watch this must watch read more   \n",

                                                                                                                          a wonderfully grim and enthralling show through the darkness is a crime drama that follows criminal profiler song ha young during the late 's to early 's as he carves a place for behavioral analysis in south korea based upon the experience of korea's first criminal profiler kwon il yong who helped write the show the show contains episode mini arcs each with their own main criminal thus the connecting factor of the episodes is song ha young and his colleagues' journey into becoming more comfortable with the art of profiling the show is stunningly realistic and does not shy away from dark matters such as murder and sexual assault the show stands out from others in the same genre due to its faithfulness to real life which makes it both gripping and horrifying if the show has one flaw it is that at times it is too realistic as it is focused on accurately portraying the process of catching criminals and creating a whole new method of investigation it at times is very slow understandably so considering real life investigations aren't often magically solved in a couple days in fact i had trouble getting through the first episode but i decided to watch the second and was so hooked i never looked back because of this realism the characters at times can be frustrating or not that very stand out i see that most people who didn't like the show did not like it because of the characters and i believe it is because of how realistic they are they aren't written to be sensational or quirky to catch viewers eyes like most characters are but rather are very nuanced and subtly fleshed out to some this means they are boring or annoying but to me they were not stagnant at all most characters experience slow and slight changes to their personality and ideals throughout the show as most real people do plus the main character song ha young is incredibly compelling from start to finish i felt that his character arc this slow descent into the minds of criminals and how he copes was amazingly written and you can really see the differences in who he is from episode to episode on the topic of song ha young kim nam gil is brilliant in his portrayal of him if i liked him in fiery priest then i loved him in this his acting is so well done particularly in his expressions i mean his gaze really makes you feel like you're being analyzed and broken down and he lends himself perfectly to song ha young who as a character is mostly well composed yet brimming with justice and anger he breathes life into this character and does a fantastic job in carrying the show and making you invested in him i really believe that no one else could have played this part like he did he's perfect for it the other actors are also wonderful although it's harder to comment on them since the shows focus is mainly on song ha young yet they do well to make the show feel realistic and make their characters feel like actual people major props should go to those who act the criminals as they often put on chilling yet human performances this show is not a 'whodunnit' show but a 'how catch em' show reminiscent of shows such as mindhunter and columbo thus it is very different from conventional thrillers which again to some coupled with the shows slower pace makes the show boring to me i felt that this made the show brilliant and even after finishing the show i just wish i had more of it it's one of those rare shows where i just know i'd watch season after season of song ha young and his job it will most definitely be a show i come back to time and time again because the joy of it is not figuring out a criminal like many mystery shows but rather the process of criminal profiling and bring justice to innocent victims i understand that this show is not for everyone especially those used to fast paced and plot twisty mysteries but it is a masterful show nonetheless as someone who loves watching content about criminal profilers this show is definitely my favorite k drama regarding to topic to date and one of my favorite portrayals of a profiler as well this is a must watch for people who like things about criminal profilers alongside those who enjoy the investigative and crime genres even if this show seems to differ from your usual tastes i implore you to give it a chance you won't regret it read more   \n",

lot of kdramas and i could always point out something about it that i hate but with this one i was just satisfied i cried i laughed i felt all of the emotions amazing cast and storyline there is no dull episode i loved how the series shows you each side of the characters that i wasn't able to hate any of them after finishing it i was contented i'm afraid of watching a new series because this was just too good   \n",

while seol yi na took the charge of screenwriting which is a debut for both of them master composer gaemi leads the music production while the show was broadcasted on sbs it had a mid season break of weeks due to winter olympics but i guess it proved rewarding to be clear this is not the depiction of the real life events of the profiler but the sequence of events are reflected from reality to a certain extent that's why the novel is nonfiction the drama is setup in late s and shows the process and struggles of establishing the behavioural analysis unit in south korean police force as well as making criminal profiling an important factor of investigation through succeeding years i think this is enough for a gist given the theme and premise of the show inspector song ha young kim na gil is

characters as well as supporting plus temporary roles was simple amazing i must mention special credits to kim nam gil and jin seon kyu who obviously were expected to carry the show on their back also the performance from the actors playing serial killers is hugely commendable plot development was stupendous let me inform you that it's neither a steady nor a plot neither a staircase development and doesn't have any connecting plot elements either rather it's more of a biographical documentary of a profiler and him solving cases one after another obviously along with people around him through a passage of time of about half a decade the pilot episodes were impressive and able to make the audience look forward to further might feel a little slow but it's a matter of time you realize that the entire show was intended to be like that the show greatly emphasizes on the methods of intensive profiling through which the male leads not only try to spread out the importance of criminal behavioral analysis but also put efforts into learning themselves there is the least amount of suspense i must mention it's bcs the writer has opted to reveal the culprits at the beginning of the cases itself on that note it's not a psychopath crime thriller or any sort lf murder mystery rather the weightage is on profiling i e how the cops exercise their brains to get to the criminal there are about major culprits throughout and each case starts while the previous is about to end song ha young's growth as a rookie profiler to an expert is worth investing your time into i feel the most amount of credit should go to the screenwriter although the drama is a novel adaptation but turning books into live action isn't as easy since the latter is more of a play script haven't read the original work but from what i saw on sns they have retained originality for most of the parts which should be commended the premises wete aptly setup and the sequence of events were perfectly arranged plus organized the momentary monologues and self notes picked my attention as well even though the focus is hugely concentrated on the mls others received a good amount of exposure as well and on that note the character arcs were drawn with great efforts and the growth in them was clearly conspicuous again especially for the mls i'm sure the directorial debut for park bo ram pdnim has been a fruitful experience directing the screenplay for such a fantastic script indeed would have brought joy to me the show didn't feel like being directed by a rookie at all in fact after watching episodes when i rushed to check out which amazing person has taken the charge it turned out to be someone i never knew of the pacing was perfect the seeming slow paced development made the entire thing more meaningful i felt the cinematography with unlit dim pallettes and dark hue was able to provide pertinent moods and gives given the catastrophic theme of the story the screen editing was good for me with less sound effects and being greatly focused on intense scenarios the criminal chasing and fighting scenes were in fact enjoyable there are soundtracks in total composed by gaemi nim and to the best of the show's vibes i think it would have been still okay with no osts and this number was okay given the least utilization lullaby by nerd connection is a harmonious depiction of dark conflicts between emotions within your heart can't run away by isaac hong is a caliginous urge to give up on everything leopard of mt kilimanjaro by men was the last track what i liked ml doesn't shadows others seemingly nonexistent bromance i couldn't concluded whether it was bromance bcs there was no eye catching portrayal but the things between ha young young soo was full of care affection and mutual respect is all i can say i loved their chemistry as partners who gave their best with the preeminent determination to get to the roots of all the cases as well as to save and develope their team bloom and fall alone is a gloomy call from heart's core about the hostilities one goes through with intriguing vocals of kim so yeon extensive emphasis on profiling oh i guess i'd have mentioned this point first this is the thing that makes the drama one of the best for years i have been waiting for something to come and level up itself with signal and may be it wasn't able to reach that but well it is the one that went the closest which makes me happy no dramatic peak elevation it's expected of a story of any form to have peaks it's one of the essential factors that we all love about but the storytelling method for this drama didn't intend to have clear cut elements of such i've explained the reason above and in fact this fact makes the show more of a realistic piece simple yet powerful and impressive again it isn't a brainy drama with intriguing plot or astonishing revelations everything has been made crystal clear for you from the beginning so what's left for you to see it's the way the detectives analyse and profile an event and personalities of criminals to get through the cause and the culprit indeed the way everything has been executed makes it highly impressive entertaining and worthy of investing your time into apt exposure to side characters i loved how the side characters and their parts were not exaggerated as fillers and were properly used especially for kim so jin ryeoun jung soon won and gong sung ha what i didn't like there's only one thing i didn't like about this drama i e in the screenplay things that could have been explained by the speaker by simply telling the scenarios was shown via quick flashbacks of the event i guess it was a screenplay strategy by the writer and director but it could have been excluded in my opinion nevertheless it didn't ruin the quality of the overall content for me final remarks i didn't have much expectations before starting this ngl and all i relied on was the cast which i admire and also the fact that the drama was on profiling but to my surprise the drama left with no option but to applaud and eulogize everywhere the overall execution of this drama including direction writing performance is definitely to the level of excellency and i would obviously recommend y'all to watch this must watch read more</td>\n",

       "      <td>a wonderfully grim and enthralling show through the darkness is a crime drama that follows criminal profiler song ha young during the late 's to early 's as he carves a place for behavioral analysis in south korea based upon the experience of korea's first criminal profiler kwon il yong who helped write the show the show contains episode mini arcs each with their own main criminal thus the connecting factor of the episodes is song ha young and his colleagues' journey into becoming more comfortable with the art of profiling the show is stunningly realistic and does not shy away from dark matters such as murder and sexual assault the show stands out from others in the same genre due to its faithfulness to real life which makes it both gripping and horrifying if the show has one flaw it is that at times it is too realistic as it is focused on accurately portraying the process of catching criminals and creating a whole new method of investigation it at times is very slow understandably so considering real life investigations aren't often magically solved in a couple days in fact i had trouble getting through the first episode but i decided to watch the second and was so hooked i never looked back because of this realism the characters at times can be frustrating or not that very stand out i see that most people who didn't like the show did not like it because of the characters and i believe it is because of how realistic they are they aren't written to be sensational or quirky to catch viewers eyes like most characters are but rather are very nuanced and subtly fleshed out to some this means they are boring or annoying but to me they were not stagnant at all most characters experience slow and slight changes to their personality and ideals throughout the show as most real people do plus the main character song ha young is incredibly compelling from start to finish i felt that his character arc this slow descent into the minds of criminals and how he copes was amazingly written and you can really see the differences in who he is from episode to episode on the topic of song ha young kim nam gil is brilliant in his portrayal of him if i liked him in fiery priest then i loved him in this his acting is so well done particularly in his expressions i mean his gaze really makes you feel like you're being analyzed and broken down and he lends himself perfectly to song ha young who as a character is mostly well composed yet brimming with justice and anger he breathes life into this character and does a fantastic job in carrying the show and making you invested in him i really believe that no one else could have played this part like he did he's perfect for it the other actors are also wonderful although it's harder to comment on them since the shows focus is mainly on song ha young yet they do well to make the show feel realistic and make their characters feel like actual people major props should go to those who act the criminals as they often put on chilling yet human performances this show is not a 'whodunnit' show but a 'how catch em' show reminiscent of shows such as mindhunter and columbo thus it is very different from conventional thrillers which again to some coupled with the shows slower pace makes the show boring to me i felt that this made the show brilliant and even after finishing the show i just wish i had more of it it's one of those rare shows where i just know i'd watch season after season of song ha young and his job it will most definitely be a show i come back to time and time again because the joy of it is not figuring out a criminal like many mystery shows but rather the process of criminal profiling and bring justice to innocent victims i understand that this show is not for everyone especially those used to fast paced and plot twisty mysteries but it is a masterful show nonetheless as someone who loves watching content about criminal profilers this show is definitely my favorite k drama regarding to topic to date and one of my favorite portrayals of a profiler as well this is a must watch for people who like things about criminal profilers alongside those who enjoy the investigative and crime genres even if this show seems to differ from your usual tastes i implore you to give it a chance you won't regret it read more</td>\n",

fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster if you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you this drama is based on a nonfiction book written by south korea's first criminal profiler given this most of the cases all except one in which i am unsure of are based on true cases in s korea the storyline is straightforward and goes in chronological order like a documentary and has several time jumps to show the years passed there were a handful of slow moments but with only episodes they weren't too bad i overlooked them for the tight story development superb acting and perfect ost and bgm some people complain that it's too slow but this is based on true events the writer of this drama can only dramaticize it so far i'm glad they stick to the facts to stay true to the true cases while adding some thrill suspense in catching the killer while the characters don't go deep into psychological analysis of the criminals we can still tell they are paying attention the personality characteristics of the killers and using them to study and prevent others the production paid close attention to detail in recreating the horrid things that occurred in the crimes especially the raincoat killer and southwestern serial killer it was quite informative to learn how criminal profiling came to be accepted in criminal investigations in korea who would have expected them to start in early s i cannot leave without commending kim nam gil who is amazing as song ha young i have no words for how he portrayed the disgust and anger from having to interview serial killers in jail his breakdown later in the drama was heartbreaking and i shed a few tears for him in empathy the rest of the cast were all great too the bromance between ha young and chief kook plus woo joo was cute and lightened up the otherwise super dark heavy drama based on true crimes i really ate up all the rare interactions between ha young and chief kook do give this a

p i n g all the cases are based on true events and criminals such as yoo young chul therefore the show has a more realistic storyline that doesn't waste time on useless sub plots cough romance or politics cough and really makes you sympathize for the victims from the media press all the way down to the clothes they were wearing when they were arrested is accurate although i would say the red hat killer's case is more fictionalized from lee chun jae please be reminded this is based off profiler kwon il yong's novel from his real accounts of being south korea's first profiler but just a bit more dramatised the drama has a serious cinematic tone but is enjoyable as it shifts between slow burn to some episodes that are very fast paced and intense especially starting from episode that had my jaw unhinged and heart racing the narrative of the criminals are shown in between investigations so you can see them commit crimes which adds to the suspense although keep in mind these criminals are not geniuses and they are humans who can be caught by studying their psychology and behaviour therefore the drama thickens even if they get caught this was also quite a while ago and the police were different back then so you have to be open minded on how they operate with their limited resources but even then they are the least annoying police force i have seen in a crime drama who have logical thinking and encourages their officers everything feels like it's meticulously set in the right time period and small references to notable past events such as and the world cup are made similarly to reply ha young is a quiet but straight forward man and even though he expresses very little kim nam gil is amazing at portraying nuanced emotions his fellow friend and profiler young soo is such a lovable and optimistic character who supports ha young along with their young intern woo joo who is a bit clueless and cute both bring such a lightheartedness to this dark show and also display their cleverness tae goo the one female detective also feels like an actual individual with her own real struggles and goals compared to many other females like her in crime dramas comedic relief is given from most of the main cast like kim won hae and lee dae yeon who are great fun supporting actors in crime dramas the acting is superb from every single character including the criminals everyone has great chemistry together and you can really tell how much the crimes affect the profilers and detectives who express human emotions all the while maintaining detached and objective as they solve crimes like the professionals they are the soundtrack is moody haunting and soft that reflects the drama beautifully and captures the essence of it isaac hong well loved and known the nerd connection a hidden k indie gem kim so yeon an ethereal angel and men triple threat with sweet contrasting voices are the ost singers it's similar to the likes of mind hunter though much more prevalent to korean history and culture it displays how even though america was developing and using profiling methods at that time the rest of the world was just grasping the idea of it it's a brilliant production that's worth watching as you will be completely immersed if you're having deja vu with these cases from seeing it in other dramas it's because these cases literally

       "2      darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that through the darkness literally those who read hearts of evil is a live action adaptation of the nonfiction novel of the same title written by kwon il yong republic of korea's first profiler and co authored by writer go na moo published in the year created by studio s and wavve through the darkness is directed by park bo ram while seol yi na took the charge of screenwriting which is a debut for both of them master composer gaemi leads the music production while the show was broadcasted on sbs it had a mid season break of weeks due to winter olympics but i guess it proved rewarding to be clear this is not the depiction of the real life events of the profiler but the sequence of events are reflected from reality to a certain extent that's why the novel is nonfiction the drama is setup in late s and shows the process and struggles of establishing the behavioural analysis unit in south korean police force as well as making criminal profiling an important factor of investigation through succeeding years i think this is enough for a gist given the theme and premise of the show inspector song ha young kim na gil is reserved and somewhat introverted with abilities of reading through emotions and is highly piercing having a traumatic experience in early childhood he has grown up into a person who seeks a simple life and want to persue his job with honesty and discipline detective kook young soo jin seon kyu is the chief of forensic analysis unit yet has aspirations to create a behavioural analysis team after being inspired from criminal profiling done by american fbi detective yoon tae goo kim so jin is the leader of special crime squad at seoul riu who always strives to bring justice jung woo ju ryeoun is a statistical analyst in the behavioural analysis team who is young yet determined and hardworking other actors in major roles are baek joon sik lee dae yeon as riu superintendent heo gil pyo kim won hae as special crime squad chief detective nam il young jung soon won as yoo tae goo's partner and oh in tak hong woo jin as the current chief of forensics the performance by each and every major characters as well as supporting plus temporary roles was simple amazing i must mention special credits to kim nam gil and jin seon kyu who obviously were expected to carry the show on their back also the performance from the actors playing serial killers is hugely commendable plot development was stupendous let me inform you that it's neither a steady nor a plot neither a staircase development and doesn't have any connecting plot elements either rather it's more of a biographical documentary of a profiler and him solving cases one after another obviously along with people around him through a passage of time of about half a decade the pilot episodes were impressive and able to make the audience look forward to further might feel a little slow but it's a matter of time you realize that the entire show was intended to be like that the show greatly emphasizes on the methods of intensive profiling through which the male leads not only try to spread out the importance of criminal behavioral analysis but also put efforts into learning themselves there is the least amount of suspense i must mention it's bcs the writer has opted to reveal the culprits at the beginning of the cases itself on that note it's not a psychopath crime thriller or any sort lf murder mystery rather the weightage is on profiling i e how the cops exercise their brains to get to the criminal there are about major culprits throughout and each case starts while the previous is about to end song ha young's growth as a rookie profiler to an expert is worth investing your time into i feel the most amount of credit should go to the screenwriter although the drama is a novel adaptation but turning books into live action isn't as easy since the latter is more of a play script haven't read the original work but from what i saw on sns they have retained originality for most of the parts which should be commended the premises wete aptly setup and the sequence of events were perfectly arranged plus organized the momentary monologues and self notes picked my attention as well even though the focus is hugely concentrated on the mls others received a good amount of exposure as well and on that note the character arcs were drawn with great efforts and the growth in them was clearly conspicuous again especially for the mls i'm sure the directorial debut for park bo ram pdnim has been a fruitful experience directing the screenplay for such a fantastic script indeed would have brought joy to me the show didn't feel like being directed by a rookie at all in fact after watching episodes when i rushed to check out which amazing person has taken the charge it turned out to be someone i never knew of the pacing was perfect the seeming slow paced development made the entire thing more meaningful i felt the cinematography with unlit dim pallettes and dark hue was able to provide pertinent moods and gives given the catastrophic theme of the story the screen editing was good for me with less sound effects and being greatly focused on intense scenarios the criminal chasing and fighting scenes were in fact enjoyable there are soundtracks in total composed by gaemi nim and to the best of the show's vibes i think it would have been still okay with no osts and this number was okay given the least utilization lullaby by nerd connection is a harmonious depiction of dark conflicts between emotions within your heart can't run away by isaac hong is a caliginous urge to give up on everything leopard of mt kilimanjaro by men was the last track what i liked ml doesn't shadows others seemingly nonexistent bromance i couldn't concluded whether it was bromance bcs there was no eye catching portrayal but the things between ha young young soo was full of care affection and mutual respect is all i can say i loved their chemistry as partners who gave their best with the preeminent determination to get to the roots of all the cases as well as to save and develope their team bloom and fall alone is a gloomy call from heart's core about the hostilities one goes through with intriguing vocals of kim so yeon extensive emphasis on profiling oh i guess i'd have mentioned this point first this is the thing that makes the drama one of the best for years i have been waiting for something to come and level up itself with signal and may be it wasn't able to reach that but well it is the one that went the closest which makes me happy no dramatic peak elevation it's expected of a story of any form to have peaks it's one of the essential factors that we all love about but the storytelling method for this drama didn't intend to have clear cut elements of such i've explained the reason above and in fact this fact makes the show more of a realistic piece simple yet powerful and impressive again it isn't a brainy drama with intriguing plot or astonishing revelations everything has been made crystal clear for you from the beginning so what's left for you to see it's the way the detectives analyse and profile an event and personalities of criminals to get through the cause and the culprit indeed the way everything has been executed makes it highly impressive entertaining and worthy of investing your time into apt exposure to side characters i loved how the side characters and their parts were not exaggerated as fillers and were properly used especially for kim so jin ryeoun jung soon won and gong sung ha what i didn't like there's only one thing i didn't like about this drama i e in the screenplay things that could have been explained by the speaker by simply telling the scenarios was shown via quick flashbacks of the event i guess it was a screenplay strategy by the writer and director but it could have been excluded in my opinion nevertheless it didn't ruin the quality of the overall content for me final remarks i didn't have much expectations before starting this ngl and all i relied on was the cast which i admire and also the fact that the drama was on profiling but to my surprise the drama left with no option but to applaud and eulogize everywhere the overall execution of this drama including direction writing performance is definitely to the level of excellency and i would obviously recommend y'all to watch this must watch read more   \n",

                                                                                                                         a wonderfully grim and enthralling show through the darkness is a crime drama that follows criminal profiler song ha young during the late 's to early 's as he carves a place for behavioral analysis in south korea based upon the experience of korea's first criminal profiler kwon il yong who helped write the show the show contains episode mini arcs each with their own main criminal thus the connecting factor of the episodes is song ha young and his colleagues' journey into becoming more comfortable with the art of profiling the show is stunningly realistic and does not shy away from dark matters such as murder and sexual assault the show stands out from others in the same genre due to its faithfulness to real life which makes it both gripping and horrifying if the show has one flaw it is that at times it is too realistic as it is focused on accurately portraying the process of catching criminals and creating a whole new method of investigation it at times is very slow understandably so considering real life investigations aren't often magically solved in a couple days in fact i had trouble getting through the first episode but i decided to watch the second and was so hooked i never looked back because of this realism the characters at times can be frustrating or not that very stand out i see that most people who didn't like the show did not like it because of the characters and i believe it is because of how realistic they are they aren't written to be sensational or quirky to catch viewers eyes like most characters are but rather are very nuanced and subtly fleshed out to some this means they are boring or annoying but to me they were not stagnant at all most characters experience slow and slight changes to their personality and ideals throughout the show as most real people do plus the main character song ha young is incredibly compelling from start to finish i felt that his character arc this slow descent into the minds of criminals and how he copes was amazingly written and you can really see the differences in who he is from episode to episode on the topic of song ha young kim nam gil is brilliant in his portrayal of him if i liked him in fiery priest then i loved him in this his acting is so well done particularly in his expressions i mean his gaze really makes you feel like you're being analyzed and broken down and he lends himself perfectly to song ha young who as a character is mostly well composed yet brimming with justice and anger he breathes life into this character and does a fantastic job in carrying the show and making you invested in him i really believe that no one else could have played this part like he did he's perfect for it the other actors are also wonderful although it's harder to comment on them since the shows focus is mainly on song ha young yet they do well to make the show feel realistic and make their characters feel like actual people major props should go to those who act the criminals as they often put on chilling yet human performances this show is not a 'whodunnit' show but a 'how catch em' show reminiscent of shows such as mindhunter and columbo thus it is very different from conventional thrillers which again to some coupled with the shows slower pace makes the show boring to me i felt that this made the show brilliant and even after finishing the show i just wish i had more of it it's one of those rare shows where i just know i'd watch season after season of song ha young and his job it will most definitely be a show i come back to time and time again because the joy of it is not figuring out a criminal like many mystery shows but rather the process of criminal profiling and bring justice to innocent victims i understand that this show is not for everyone especially those used to fast paced and plot twisty mysteries but it is a masterful show nonetheless as someone who loves watching content about criminal profilers this show is definitely my favorite k drama regarding to topic to date and one of my favorite portrayals of a profiler as well this is a must watch for people who like things about criminal profilers alongside those who enjoy the investigative and crime genres even if this show seems to differ from your usual tastes i implore you to give it a chance you won't regret it read more   \n",

of kdramas and i could always point out something about it that i hate but with this one i was just satisfied i cried i laughed i felt all of the emotions amazing cast and storyline there is no dull episode i loved how the series shows you each side of the characters that i wasn't able to hate any of them after finishing it i was contented i'm afraid of watching a new series because this was just too good   \n",
